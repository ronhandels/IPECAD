The model is based on a reconstruction of an existing model often named 'SveDem' described here: https://www.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-191055
This version is meant as a beta version to replicate the identical outcomes as the original model available in TreeAge and Excel, for which some information is provided by the orginal developers.
