This readme only contains an installation guide and version history. A description of the model and its input estimates can be found here: Handels et al. \[2024\] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.07.009. 

The branch "main" is for development and fune tuning before release. The branch "develop" is for development, experimenting and exploring new features, it is not necessarily stable. Releases are stable versions often associated to specific applications of the model. 

A simplified version for education purposes is available in the 'education' branch, but is under development. 

# Installation tutorial R version (for inexperienced R/github users)

- Download files: go to https://github.com/ronhandels/IPECAD, then click "Code" (green button) and then "Download ZIP" on PC. 
- Unzip folder. 
- Move unzipped folder to desired location on PC. 
- Make sure to have R (https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and ideally RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com) installed. 
- Open R file named "IPECAD open-source model.R" in R (or RStudio)
- Install `dampack` by running the code `install.packages("dampack")` in R (this code is located under the heading `# MANUAL PREPARATION #`; to activate the code remove the `#` at the beginning of the line).
- Set the working directory to the file path where the unzipped folder is stored (this code is located under the heading `# MANUAL PREPARATION #`; change the code manually or alternatively in RStudio go to the menu "Session" then "Set Working Directory" then "To Source File Location" (or to "Choose Directory..." and choose the location of the unzipped folder)).
- Run the code by sourcing it (in R go to the menu "File" then "Source R code..."; in RStudio go to the menu "Code" then "Source")
- We recommend familiarizing with the description of the model using the details related to the releases described below.

# Version details

## v2.3.0 (2024; released)

This version has been developed as an open-source framework with details found here: Handels et al. \[2024\] https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.07.009. In this manuscript we describe the new IPECAD open-source model framework (version 2) for the health-economic evaluation of early AD treatment and aim to apply it in 3 use cases for AD lecanemab treatment: 1) cross-validating an existing model with a similar structure (ICER), 2) cross-validating an existing model with a more complex structure (AD-ACE) and 3) assessing additional uncertainty scenarios. 

This version has been developed and/or supported by:

## v2.2.0-beta (2024; released)

This version is used for the IPECAD workshop model cross-comparison 2023. Details can be found here: 

-  ISPOR 2023 abstract: abstract: <https://www.ispor.org/heor-resources/presentations-database/presentation/euro2023-3788/131246>

## v2.0.1-alpha (2023)

We replaced any (non-rounded input) estimates or information not in the public domain with (rounded) input estimates or information available in the public domain. Specifically, this refers to the following aspects:

-   The original 'SveDem' model used a Swedish life table to apply mortality. The mortality rate was based on the weighted mean rate for men and women (weights based on the prevalence of age and sex in the Swedish population). For the model replication this was changed by using an updated Swedish life table and a sex-specific mortality rate.
-   The original 'SveDem' model multiplied the transition probability from MCI to mild dementia and from mild dementia to moderate dementia with the treatment effect expressed as a ratio. For the model replication this was changed by first transforming the transition probability to a rate, then multiplying it with the treatment effect expressed as a ratio, then transformed back to a transition probability.
-   The original 'SveDem' model used non-rounded input estimates for transition probabilities and mortality hazard ratios. For the model replication this was changed to only using estimates as publicly available in the publication (see supplemental material of earlier 'SveDem' model publication).

This version is not publicly available given its the alpha version status.

## v2.0.0-alpha (2023)

An existing model \[Wimo et al. 2020: <https://www.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-191055>\] (further referred to as 'original SveDem model') was reconstructed in terms of its disease progression part. This original SveDem model was a cohort-based Markov model and consisted of health states Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), mild dementia, moderate dementia, severe dementia and death. Progression between states was modeled with a cycle length of 1 year simulating from age 60 to 100. See publication for a detailed acknowledgment of the developers and funders (partly funded by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA).

Reconstruction of the original SveDem model was done by the original developers Anders Wimo and Ron Handels using original non-rounded input estimates available in the original model format TreeAge and Excel. The reconstructed model produced the same model outcomes in terms of mean person-years per person per state and alive (table 1 and table 4 from earlier mentioned 'SveDem' model publication) when rounded to 2 decimal points, except for person-years in severe dementia after 40 years which had an absolute deviation of 0.01 person-years. Anders Wimo and Ron Handels considered this a sufficient reflection of internal validity. No specific funding was received for this reconstruction.

This version is not publicly available given the dependency on non-publicly available information and its alpha version status.
