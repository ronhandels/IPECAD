This GitHub repository provides the “IPECAD Open-Source Model v2 -
Single-Domain” for cost-effectiveness analysis of Alzheimer’s disease
interventions. Initial developement consisted of reconstructing an
existing model by several members of the IPECAD modeling group (see
details below). It differs from the IPECAD Open-Source Model v1 -
Multi-Domain (detailed on www.ipecad.org/open-source-model).

The model is available in 3 formats under a public license that allows
obtaining the source code and making changes.

Generally, the formats are based on the same underlying inputs list and
strategy and scenario functions (see model code for details). See below
for details on versioning and repository files for differences between
them.

## Installation tutorial R version

-   go to <https://github.com/ronhandels/ipecad/> \> click on ‘\<\>
    Code’ (green button) \> click on ‘Download ZIP’ \> unzip all files
-   install R
-   install RStudio (optional but suggested)
-   install `dampack` by running the code `install.packages("dampack")`
-   open file ‘IPECAD open-source model.R’ in RStudio (or R)
-   in the code under chapter ‘TECHNICAL PREPARATION’ change the working
    directory `~/GitHub/IPECAD` to the directory you have stored the
    file ‘IPECAD open-source model.R’ in to make sure the life table in
    the subfolder is correctly referred to.
-   we recommend familiarizing with the general description of the model
    provided below and the description of its input sources detailed

## Background

Limited health-care resources require choices on how to distribute them.
Cost-effectiveness analysis assesses the value an intervention to inform
such choice. A decision-analytic model can be used when available
empirical health-economic data are limited, for example to extrapolate
beyond a randomized controlled trial follow-up period. Transparency and
credibility of decision-models are key for their results to be used by
decision-makers.

Recent drug developments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have increased
attention for decision-analytic models to assess their value. We aim to
develop an open-source AD decision-model framework for the
health-economic evaluation of AD interventions. We believe an
open-source model supports transparency and credibility, and can be used
to externally validate results generated by other decision-analytic
models in AD. We welcome attributions to the model on github.

Here we describe the methods and code of the open-source model for
cost-effectiveness analysis of Alzheimer’s disease interventions.

## Method

A cohort state-transition Markov model has been developed. Initial
developement consisted of reconstructing an existing model in terms of
its disease progression part (see
<https://www.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-191055>). Then, inputs were changed and
new features were added. See ‘Version details’ for more information. It
differs from the IPECAD open-source model released in 2019 (published on
<https://doi-org.mu.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2019.05.004> and
available from www.ipecad.org/open-source-model).

### Features and assumptions

The model has the following features and assumptions:

-   The model simulates 2 strategies: standard of care ‘soc’ and
    intervention ‘int’; further referred to as a scenario (e.g., base
    case scenario).
-   The markov states include mild cognitive impairment ‘mci’, mild
    dementia ‘mil’, moderate dementia ‘mod’, severe dementia ‘sev’ and
    death ‘dth’; with MCI and mild dementia split into on- and
    off-treatment. Dementia health states were defined by the
    Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) categorized into mild (30-21),
    moderate (20-10) and severe (0-9).
-   Transitions between health states other than death are simulated
    time-independent.
-   Non-death transition are conditional on being alive. Some
    non-sequential and backtransitions are allowed. On/off treatment
    conditions are independent of health state and unidirectional (only
    on to off). Transitions to institutionalization are unidirectional
    (only to institutionalization). Institutional setting does not
    contain treatment effects.
-   Mortality is implemented by multiplying an age- and sex-specific
    life table (user-defined) with the relative risk for death by
    disease severity state.
-   A cycle length of 1 year is employed with half-cycle correction
    operationalized as taking the mean of the health-economic outcomes
    at each 2 subsequent cycles.
-   The time horizon is variable, up to the age of 99.
-   The base population (user-defined) is defined by age (single age
    between 50-99) and sex (male or female), both used to select the
    corresponding age- and sex-specific mortality rate from a general
    population life table at each cycle.
-   Treatment effect is implemented as a relative risk with which
    forward transition rates (user-selected) were multiplied with. In
    the standard of care strategy all start off treatment, in the
    intervention strategy all start in on treatment.
-   Discounting (user-defined) is applied on the half-cycle corrected
    estimates.
-   The model runs for male or female separately. It is up to the
    end-user to provide weighted mean results.

Notes on input estimates for the base case scenario:

-   p.mci_mil: transition probability between MCI and dementia was
    obtained from a rate reflecting AD high likelihood group defined as
    abnormal CSF & tau, or abnormal amyloid PET \[Vos et al. 2015:
    <https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awv029>\]. Transitions were assumed
    to mild stage of dementia (not moderate or severe). The 3-year
    cumulative incidence probability of 61% was converted to a 3-year
    rate using ‘-log(1-0.61)=0.94’, then converted to a 1-year rate
    dividing it by 3 ‘0.94/3=0.31’, then converted to a 1-year
    probability using ‘1-exp(-0.31)=0.27’.
-   p.mil_mod, p.mil_sev… etc: transition probabilities between dementia
    states were obtained from predicted values of an ordered probit
    model fitted to data from the Swedisch Dementia Registry (SveDem)
    longitudinal cognitive status after controlling for drop-out
    \[Handels et al. 2020: <https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12050>\].
    Cognitive status was reflected by the Mini-Mental State Examination
    (MMSE) and categorized as mild dementia (21-30), moderate dementia
    (10-20) or severe dementia (0-9) health state.

### Alternative input estimates

Alternative input estimates from Vos et al. \[2015:
<https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awv029>\] are:

-   Amyloid positive and neuronal loss undetermined. This is reflected
    by diagnostic criteria NIA-AA groups ‘High Alzheimer’s disease
    likelihood group’ and ‘Conflicting IAP group’, with 3-year
    cumulative incidence probability of 59% (AD dementia) and 4% (non-AD
    dementia), and 22% (AD dementia) and (4%) of dementia and with
    prevalence of 353 and 49 respectively. This results into a weighted
    3-year cumulative incidence of ‘1-exp(- ( (-log(1-0.59) +
    -log(1-0.04))*353 + (-log(1-0.22) + -log(1-0.04))*49 ) / (353+49)
    )=0.57’ and corresponding 1-year probability of ‘1-exp(-
    -log(1-0.57)/3)=0.24’
-   Amyloid positive and neuronal loss undetermined. This is reflected
    by diagnostic criteria NIA-AA group ‘High Alzheimer’s disease
    likelihood group’, with 3-year cumulative incidence probability of
    59%, corresponding to a 1-year probability of ‘1-exp(-
    -log(1-0.59)/3)=0.26’

## Basic overview of model code (R version)

The model code is build-up as follows:

The model is run using 2 functions: run function `f.run_strategy` and
run function `f.run_scenario`. The second function (`f.run_scenario`)
includes a loop over all strategies by calling them one by one. Overall,
the code follows these steps:

-   A: function to run a scenario
-   B: prepare and initialize objects to store scenario and strategy
    outcomes
-   C: run each strategy in a loop
-   D: prepare inputs to be used in each strategy
-   E: run preparations specific for the intervention strategy
-   F: store newly created or updated inputs to be used for the function
    to run a single strategy
-   G: run the strategy
    -   G1: prepare transition probability matrix
    -   G2: some checks
    -   G3: initialize objects to store strategy outcomes
    -   G4: starting state
    -   G5: markov multiplication by looping over cycles
    -   G6: multiply states with utility and cost estimates
    -   G7: apply half-cycle correction
    -   G8: apply discounting
    -   G9: store outcomes to be wrapped up by the ‘run scenario’
        function
-   H: store strategy results
-   I: add strategy results to scenario outcomes

## Coding reference

Standard naming for objects is ‘x.y.object_name’ with:

x:

v = vector m = matrix a = array df = data frame l = list

y:

p = probability or proportion r = rate rr = relative risk hr = hazard
ratio n = number u = utility c = cost

Other naming:

f.name = function temp.name = temporary object

This is based on recommendations by
<https://github.com/DARTH-git/darthpack> (<https://rdcu.be/bRP5h> table
3).

<!-- ### transition probability matrix explained -->
<!-- [Will follow] -->
<!-- ... contains TPs between states, also over time -->
<!-- ... array is matrices stacked... refer to them by ... array[x,y,z] dimensions -->
<!-- ... video on time dependent TPs can be found here, and example code -->
<!-- .. explain a.TP... in our model -->
<!-- Within Markov processes, a TP matrix is used to describe the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another within a discrete-time Markov chain. Each element of the matrix represents the probability of moving from one state to another in one time step. This probability of transitioning to a future state only depends on the current state.  -->
<!-- The following table represents a simple TP matrix for the disease states relevant to dementia Alzheimer's disease states that were used in this model, the values within the TP matrix are randomized. The rows represent the current disease state, the columns represent the next possible disease states. The value in the matrix represents the TP within the given cycle length.  -->

<!-- 1. how the cycle-dependent TP matrix looks like (basically, explain how arrays work in a simple example and refer to details online R book).  -->
<!-- 2. explain how the 2 functions work with a simple example (so function `scenario` is used to prepare the inputs, then function `strategy` runs a strategy, then `scenario` takes the results and stores it (something along these lines). And refer to the available dampack R vignette and indicate we used that as an example.  -->
<!-- 3. explain the Markov principle and data dependencies:  -->
<!-- The model is build-up with the following dependencies: -->
<!-- * starting demographics (age and sex) and time are independent.  -->
<!-- * disease state 'dementia onset' is a function of time.  -->
<!-- * disease states within dementia are a function of the history if disease state (only 1 cycle back); indirectly they are a function of time.  -->
<!-- * death is a function of demographics and disease state.  -->
<!-- * QALYs & costs are a function of disease state and death.  -->
<!-- 5. Debugging basics: explain really quickly how the debuggint function in rstudio works (search for a video and web-page you can refer to). -->
<!-- 6. explain PSA (and refer to dampack) -->
<!-- 7. refer to a video on basic principles of markov matrix multiplication (part in the code with the %*%).

<!-- 8. explain how a list works -->
<!-- 9. explain how treatment waning works: temp.waning <- (1-tx_waning)^(0:(n.cycle-1)) -->
<!-- 10. explain that '# probability of remaining in the same state' needed to be updated in the intervention strategy -->

## Version details

### main branch (planned to be released as v2.2.0-beta in late 2023)

This is for development and fine tuning before release, it is intended
to be stable but not guaranteed.

It extends v2.1.0 with new features (transitions to
institutionalization, table/graph outcomes), new inputs (estimate of the
transition from MCI to mild dementia, estimate for state-specific costs
in community and institutional setting) and fixes (half-cycle correction
before discounting).

This version has been developed by: Ron Handels (main developer,
Maastricht University - Netherlands) and Linh Nguyen.

### newfeatures branch

This is for development, experimenting and exploring new features, it is
not necessarily stable.

### v2.1.0-beta (2023; released)

This version was build for the abstract submitted to ISPOR Europe 2023.

This version has been developed and/or supported by:

-   Ron Handels (main developer, Maastricht University - Netherlands)
-   Anders Wimo
-   Anders Sköldunger
-   Ashley Tate
-   Bengt Winblad
-   Daphne Silvertand
-   Linh Nguyen
-   Linus Jönsson
-   Sabine Grimm
-   Sandar Aye
-   Will Herring

### v2.0.1-alpha (2023)

We replaced any (non-rounded input) estimates or information not in the
public domain with (rounded) input estimates or information available in
the public domain. Specifically, this refers to the following aspects:

-   The original ‘SveDem’ model used a Swedish life table to apply
    mortality. The mortality rate was based on the weighted mean rate
    for men and women (weights based on the prevalence of age and sex in
    the Swedish population). For the model replication this was changed
    by using an updated Swedish life table and a sex-specific mortality
    rate.
-   The original ‘SveDem’ model multiplied the transition probability
    from MCI to mild dementia and from mild dementia to moderate
    dementia with the treatment effect expressed as a ratio. For the
    model replication this was changed by first transforming the
    transition probability to a rate, then multiplying it with the
    treatment effect expressed as a ratio, then transformed back to a
    transition probability.
-   The original ‘SveDem’ model used non-rounded input estimates for
    transition probabilities and mortality hazard ratios. For the model
    replication this was changed to only using estimates as publicly
    available in the publication (see supplemental material of earlier
    ‘SveDem’ model publication).

This version is not publicly available given its the alpha version
status.

This version has been developed by:

-   Ron Handels
-   Anders Wimo
-   Linh Nguyen
-   Daphne Silvertand

### v2.0.0-alpha (2023)

An existing model \[Wimo et al. 2020:
<https://www.doi.org/10.3233/JAD-191055>\] (further referred to as
‘original SveDem model’) was reconstructed in terms of its disease
progression part. This original SveDem model was a cohort-based Markov
model and consisted of health states Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),
mild dementia, moderate dementia, severe dementia and death. Progression
between states was modeled with a cycle length of 1 year simulating from
age 60 to 100. See publication for a detailed acknowledgment of the
developers and funders (partly funded by Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth,
NJ, USA).

Reconstruction of the original SveDem model was done by the original
developers Anders Wimo and Ron Handels using original non-rounded input
estimates available in the original model format TreeAge and Excel. The
reconstructed model produced the same model outcomes in terms of mean
person-years per person per state and alive (table 1 and table 4 from
earlier mentioned ‘SveDem’ model publication) when rounded to 2 decimal
points, except for person-years in severe dementia after 40 years which
had an absolute deviation of 0.01 person-years. Anders Wimo and Ron
Handels considered this a sufficient reflection of internal validity. No
specific funding was received for this reconstruction.

This version is not publicly available given the dependency on
non-publicly available information and its alpha version status.

This version has been developed by:

-   Ron Handels
-   Anders Wimo
